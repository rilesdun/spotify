# Create a Custom Spotify Playlist with Terraform

This repository is an extension of the [Create a Spotify Playlist with Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/community-providers/spotify-playlist) tutorial. 

It contains Terraform configuration that I have customized to create my own Spotify playlist.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for creating your own custom Spotify playlists using Terraform.
